# TimeFlies Android API28
Time Flies is an effective and easy-to-use Android app that helps users gain control of their screen time. 
First, simply register with your email and a password.

As you launch the app for the first time, the apps ask for the necessary permissions, including access the app usage data, permission to overlay on top of other apps, and auto-lauch function. These permissions allow Time Flies to access your app usage data, show useful dialog on other apps, and be notified when other apps are launched.

Once you have given us the permission. You can set up your white list. Because we understand that there are some activities that just need to be done on the phone, the white list settings ensures that we do not track your usage time of these apps.

Next , set up your black list. Add the apps that you want time restriction turned on.

When you open an app on the black list, there will always be a pop-up notification requiring you to determine the time you choose to spend and determine your goal.

A notification will pop up to remind you when the timer has 5 mins left.

When the timer runs out, you can choose to follow your restriction and close the app, or set another timer with new goals.

However, thereâ€™s also a record of the total screen usage of all the black-listed Apps.

Lastly, only if you give permission, you can see where you rank is in our global Time Flies ranking list.

Time Flies will only track the usage time of the apps that you want. Time Flies will only add time restrictions to the apps that you allow.

Use Time Flies to minimise your screen time in a practical and easy way.
