# TimeFlies Android API28
Time Flies is an effective and easy-to-use Android app that helps users gain control of their screen time. 
First, simply register with your email and a password.

As you launch the app for the first time, the app will ask for the necessary permissions, including access to app usage data, permission for app overlay, and auto-lauch function. These permissions allow Time Flies to access your app usage data, show useful dialog on top of other apps, and be notified when other apps are launched.

Once you have given us the permissions, you can set up your white list. Because we understand that there are some activities that just need to be done on the phone, the white list settings ensures that we do not track your usage time of these apps.

Next, set up your black list. Add the apps that you want time restriction turned on.

When you open an app on the black list, there will always be a pop-up screen requiring you to determine the time you choose to spend. You can add an optional 'goal' to remind you when the time is up.

A notification will pop up to remind you when the timer has 5 mins left.

When the timer runs out, you can choose to follow your restriction and close the app, or set another timer with new goals.

However, thereâ€™s also a record of the total screen usage of all the black-listed Apps. You are prompted to type in your desired time screen for a day when you first set up the app. In future versions, Time Flies will deature a calendar view detailing the history of your daily screen time behaviour. It will give you a clear overview of how many days you have reached your goals, and award you with badges, encoraging you to be in control over your ditigal life. If you have not depleted the daily screen time goal for over 7 consecutive days, Time Flies will encourage you to set a new goal.

Lastly, only if you give us the permission, you can upload your daily screen time and compare it with other users in our global Time Flies ranking list.

Time Flies will only track the usage time of the apps that you want. Time Flies will only add time restrictions to the apps that you allow.

Use Time Flies to minimise your screen time in a practical and easy way.
